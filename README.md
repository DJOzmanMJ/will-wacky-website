## Personal website for fork testing

I've forked Will's repo and made the following changes:
- Changed an image in the header;
- Changed the text in the paragraph, located in the header;
- Changed the text in the paragraph, located in the footer

I have also put it <a href="https://github.com/DJOzmanMJ/will-wacky-website">online</a>
